# Design Agent Lab

We believe AI is here to automate the daily design routine 
and help us focus on what matters — the craft.

Here you will find an open source library of agent skills 
for your design workflow. Built by designers, for designers.

## What is a Skill?
A skill is a folder of instructions that teaches an AI agent 
how to perform a specific design task — from setting up 
Figma Console MCP to running a UX research session.

## Skills
